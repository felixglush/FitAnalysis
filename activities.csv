2671851636,"Sep 1, 2019, 12:21:24 PM",Day 4: Kingston to Brockville,Ride,"My setup:
- 17 L saddle bag
- 3.5 L frame bag
- 1x12 L, 1x15 L compression bag
- 0.75 L top tube bag
- snack pouch
- 0 degree sleeping bag
- 2 person tent
- sleeping pad
- 1 tube, chain breaker, quick link, cleat bolts, hockey tape, small piece of chain, 2 strings

Clothes went into the 12 L compression bag in my saddle bag which also held the pads, pillow, and rain coat. The saddle bag also had a bungie strap that was ultra useful for holding stuff like brie cheese, loaf of bread, sandwiches, tofu, and drying swim clothes mid ride.

Tools, lights and cables, utensils, sunscreen, and laundry string went into the frame pack. We used the string to hang and air out our clothes overnight.

The tent and fly went into my 15 L compression bag along with my sleeping bag. We tied that bag to the aero bars with some string. 

The top tube bag held a 20,000 mAh battery, my phone, and cards (debit, cc, id, health card). The battery lasted us 4 days charging a Wahoo Element Bolt GPS, 2 phones, a headlamp, a 650 lumen light, and a 500 lumen light. The battery was down to 3% by the end of the trip. 

The snack pouch held a tube that didn't fit anywhere else and a bunch of coconut almond date snacks. I also put a bottle of apple juice in it once. 

The weather couldn't have been better - it didn't rain and was never too hot. I think we would have been fine without a 15 L dry sack we brought and my rain coat but it did help keep the mosquitos out and keep me warm with a thin fleece sweater.

Sleeping bag was always warm enough too. 

Notes on body pain: the muscles were completely fine. It was the contact points that hurt. By the end of day 2 the bottoms of my feet were on fire so insoles or better fitting shoes would have been helpful. And chamois butter?

Woke up at 3 am to meet up with a group of WCC+1 Bateman's bikepackers at their campsite outside Paris around 7 am. A couple of hours of gravel, singletrack, sandy paths, an old bridge once used for a railway line and a few hidden walk-only bridges later we were in Ayr with 140 km to go. 

It started to drizzle as we were riding on the outskirt of someone's farm field into a forest, Kevin got a flat, and then it really started to rain. The bikepackers kept going but it was all part of the fun as Hyrum, Joel, and I chased them down. The rain and cloud cover kept the temperature comfortable. 

Quote of the day: ""hey are we going over there? It's sunny there"". ""Ya in like 3-4 hours"". But the day went by quickly riding with people and the sun came out in the home stretch. Super fun ride overall. Would definitely do it again.
